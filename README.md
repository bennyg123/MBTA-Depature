Description:

This application is a simple depature board showing which lines depart from each stop along with their arrival times, direction and last stop.
I used rollup and typescript for this project as these are both technologies I am familiar with and I believe typescript is a better alternative 
to javascript as the type safety results in fewer eariers. In addition rollup with closure compiler offers better compression overall resulting in a smaller bundle size.
